                    This page is dedicated to my beloved Chief, a Roborovski dwarf hamster who enjoyed
                    eating food, drinking water, storing food in his cheeks, sleeping for many hours, 
                    exploring his surroundings, burrowing through his home, and exercising on his hamster 
                    wheel. He will always be remembered as a handsome, cute, funny, and quick-moving hamster.
                    Chief, I hope you enjoyed your life as  Roborovski dwarf hamster and enjoyed spending
                    time with my family and I with happy memories!
