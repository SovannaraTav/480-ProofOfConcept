# 480-ProofOfConcept

## Project Description
This mini proof-of-concept website application was meant to be small introduction to using tools and technologies used in front end development to practice designing and implementing an user interface as well as applying human-computer interaction (HCI) principles taught in CSS 480.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) using the Next.js framework. Additional tools and technologies include HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, React UI library, and the Vercel cloud platform.

## Getting Started
First, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
